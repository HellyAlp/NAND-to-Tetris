                           Project 8 - Virtual Machine 2
                           ----------------------- 
  

Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
main.py - The main file runs the complete program. It runs the file
               reader, a method that finds the relevant files to translate.
               Than it creates an parser and code objects and run the relevant
                methods.
CodeWriter-   A class representing the code part of the  Virtual Machine process. It is
            	      in charge of converting the commands to its assembly representation.
					In this project the code writer is able to cope with more complex actions-
					we added an implementation of commands like- function, goto, if-goto, initialization and return.
Parser.py - A class represents the parsing stage in the Virtual Machine. 
 


Remarks
-------
This ex is an exstention of project 7.
In this project we extended the Code Writer section and now our VMtranslator can translate
 more complex actions like loops, function, return commands etc.
